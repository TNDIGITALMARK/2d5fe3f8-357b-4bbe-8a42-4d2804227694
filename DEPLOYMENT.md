# Static Deployment Instructions

## Overview
This TrainSpotter Hub frontend has been converted to a purely client-side static application with no server dependencies.

## Build Process
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The build creates static files in the `out/` directory.

## Deployment Options

### 1. Static File Hosting Services
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `out/` folder
- **Vercel**: Connect repository and deploy (automatically detects static export)
- **GitHub Pages**: Upload `out/` contents to `gh-pages` branch
- **AWS S3**: Upload `out/` contents to S3 bucket with static website hosting
- **Firebase Hosting**: Deploy `out/` directory

### 2. Web Server (Apache/Nginx)
Copy contents of `out/` directory to your web server's document root.

### 3. Local Testing
```bash
cd out
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```
